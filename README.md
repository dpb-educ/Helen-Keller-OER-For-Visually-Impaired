# Helen-Keller-OER-For-Visually-Impaired

Welcome to the Helen-Keller-OER-For-Visually-Impaired project! Our goal is to create open-source, accessible pre-school math and science curricula, with a special focus on the needs of visually impaired students to promote inclusivity.

## Our Mission

This project aims to create awareness about the educational needs of visually impaired students and to promote inclusivity. The top suggestions will be segregated as an open educational resource and will hopefully be recommended to schools, the Department of Education, and the Commission on Higher Education.

## Dynamic Annual Curriculum

Our aim is to have a dynamic annual curriculum that will change based on the perceived needs of the students and trends from the past year. Your contributions and votes are vital in shaping this evolving curriculum.
